    <h1>Germany</h1>
    <p>
      Most of the government funded univerisites have no tuition fees and
      students only have to bother about living expenses (ranging from 8 to 9
      lakhs per year) in terms of financial obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admission for fall begins by Feb and end by April or so. Last date of
      submission of application highly depends on University
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two mediums of language namely German and English for master’s
      program in Germany. The application requirement and the selection criteria
      is highly subjective to particular department in the particular
      university. So it is very important to check the program requirement in
      the desired university
    </p>
    <p>
      In Germany, very few universities and programs require GRE. But those who
      do are majorly concerned with your score in QUANTITATIVE. If GRE is a
      requirement, make sure to score above 160 at the least. A score above 165
      is considered good and those upto 168 and above gives 90 to 95% chance of
      clearing admission requirement. For Verbal, score above 150 or 155 is
      appreciable (but do verify once from admission requirements page)
    </p>
    <p>
      It is recommended to learn up to A2 level before going to Germany, as it
      is a requirement for part time jobs offered around university. The
      advantages and disadvantages of both options are listed below.
    </p>
    <h2>English</h2>
    <p>
      Here the entire course of study is in English. The level of German
      required for application is usually “None” (but also subjective to
      university, so verify once). However, once you get an admit, the visa
      process requires a level up to A1 or A2. This is to make sure that you
      communicate well during your stay. Advantages
    </p>
    <ul>
      <h3>Advantages</h3>
      <li>
        i. Minimum level of German proficiency is A1 or A2 depending on
        university.
      </li>
      <li>
        ii. The curriculum is easy to comprehend and less chances of failing
        exams.
      </li>
      <li>
        iii. Lesser expense and hassle in learning higher and tougher German
        level
      </li>
      <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
      <li>
        i. Limits the number of universities one can apply to, multifold. If
        there are 100 universities in Germany related to your interest, only 12
        to 20 will offer courses in English, which obviously increases the
        competition exponentially.
      </li>
      <li>
        ii. After graduation, one may face challenges in landing job
        opportunities if they are not accustomed to German level up to B2 or C1.
        Knowing up to C1 is important for landing a good job, and many say it
        can’t be done without.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>German</h2>
    <p>Here the program is taught in German Language. No English whatsoever is used and the application process demands certificate up to B2 or C1 level for admission. </p>
    <ul>
      <h3>Advantages</h3>
      <li>i.	One can apply to all the universities there are in Germany. So 90 to 95% chances in getting into the desired university.</li>
      <li>ii.	Ease in finding part time job opportunities, internships, full time job etc</li>
      <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
      <li>i.	The course is rigorous and many students fail to comprehend the German level even after having C1 certificates.</li>
      <li>ii.	Chances are there that you fail exams or even semesters due to this.</li>
    </ul>

      This can be achieved in multiple ways and has specific timeline (mentioned
      in blue) <p>a. The first step is to figure out your area of interest. It may
      be a topic within the department you belong or maybe even outside. (Begin
      by June of 5th Semester) For example, considering a student from
      Mechanical Engineering department, there are numerous subjects like
      thermodynamics, heat transfer, CFD, manufacturing, material science,
      automobile etc</p><p> b. You need to figure out which of these subjects interests
      you the most. Say, Automobile. Now even this topic has endless
      sub-sections like IC engine, powertrains, electric vehicles, material
      science, design of components, heat transfer, autonomous driving, battery
      etc. It is important to have an overall idea about each of these topics.
      (complete by mid November)</p><p> c. Second step is to choose what exactly you’d
      like to pursue in your master’s program. This decision can be made using a
      variety of parameters, each having individual priority level. (Complete by
      December end) <p>i. Personal Interest:- This is generally governed by the
      people one is surrounded with during 12th and U.G. People are usually
      aware about topics, only upto the extent their friends and family are
      aware. At this stage you can figure out what exactly your AOI (area of
      interest) is through atleast a month of self-introspection. (minimum a
      month)</p><p> ii. Scope of development:- If you’re willing to spend 50 to 60
      lakhs in US for M.Sc or 20-30 Lakhs in Germany/U.K, it is crucial that you
      land a high paying job at its end. This severely depend on the subjects
      you choose, which aim at the particular job market in that country. The
      companies need to sponsor your visa, and if you know stuff which is same
      as their own citizen, it’s difficult to compete with them. So it’s very
      important you enter a field which is new, developing and have a great
      demand to land that mouth drooling high salaried job. For instance, people
      from Tech backgrounds land a job much easily due to high demand as
      compared to those from manufacturing backgrounds.</p></p> <p>d. Third Step is to
      approach a professor in your institute who is active in this field. The
      early you approach, the better. Approach can be made as a group, however
      singular is preferable as it gives more freedom in pursuing different
      topics. (complete by mid to end Jan of 6th Semester) </p><p></p>e. 9 out of 10 times
      the professor won’t have much idea about the topic you chose but is only
      remotely related to the “subject”. That’s okay. You need not change your
      goals according to the availability of resources (that comes later XD).
      All you need to do is convince him to work under you and simply guide you
      in terms of set progress and connect you with appropriate people working
      on the same topic.</p><p> f. Fourth step is to begin your project. This means
      start talking to people. Call everyone and anyone you know or have contact
      of working on the same topic as yours. This will give you an idea what
      you’ll be getting yourself into. This will also let you know the numerous
      resources you should access that shall help you in developing the skills
      necessary for your research project. (complete by Feb end)</p><p> g. As you gain
      knowledge, usually by reading journals and books of you AOI, start making
      a report. List down names of important topics, made assumptions and
      derived conclusions. Now comes the best part. Knowing what exactly you’re
      “supposed” to do with this.</p><p> h. The aim, the ultimate aim, is to find a
      problem statement. Finding the PS is 60% of your job. Solving it is next
      30% and publishing it is remaining 10. How to find problem statement </p><p>I.
      List down all the assumptions. Now alter one of them, and see how the
      results deflect. Now see how this assumption can be changed from ideal to
      real situation and in what way the model should be changed to give results
      for this real situation. This is one of the most difficult task to
      achieve, but can be done in steps and partial efficiency.</p><p> II. List down
      all the conclusions. Many of them will be subjective to specific
      parameters, surrounding conditions and theorems. You can simple alter
      these parameters and derive results for your choice of control condition.
      This is one of the easiest way of achieving results but also done by many.
      So the main thing is to dig into a topic where few people have reached so
      far. And dig in quick.</p><p> i. Fifth step is to get an idea of what is the
      current technological situation in this topic. How it is flawed, where it
      needs work and what can be done to improve it. Great! If you’re professor
      is experienced enough, he definitely receives invitation for National and
      International Conferences. These are topic oriented and their purpose is
      only to gather scholars and researchers under one roof, and “discuss”
      current technological status. That’s it. You need not achieve ground
      breaking results or develop models or algorithms no one has even seen or
      some shit. Only addressing problem statements, their assumptions and
      conclusions, and what can be done to solve them is more than enough. For
      more details on this, click here. (complete by April end of 6th Semester)
    </p><p> j. Submit your work for two to three reports in International conferences
      like this with DOI numbers are you’re academic profile is set for master’s
      application. (If the conference is in first week of January 2021, they
      usually accept Abstracts and Paper by June end of 2021. After 2 to 3
      months from Jan, you’ll finally get your DOI link) Carry on with your
      research (if time permits), and one can also end up with a good research
      journal in their name, in U.G!</p>

      <p>GRE preparation timeline is highly subjective. Still here’s a brief
      dissection of the preparation process. It can be cleared in 4 months or
      even less if studied dedicatedly for. Some people may even require 6 or
      more months depending on their retaining capacity.</p><p> There are ONLY two
      parts. English. Mathematics.</p>
      <ul> Paper Pattern:-<li>  Writing (1hour)</li><li>  Verbal
      Reasoning (30 minutes)</li><li>  Quantitative Reasoning (35 minutes)</li>  <li>Verbal
      Reasoning (30 minutes)</li> <li>Quantitative Reasoning (35 minutes)</li><li> 
      Verbal/Quantitative (30/35 minutes)</li></ul> <p>Out of the last 5 sections, 4 are
      fixed. Remaining one can be either Quant or Verbal and this is not scored.
      However there is no way of knowing whether the 2nd or 3rd of 4th or 5th or
      6th section is the special one. In personal experience of many candidates,
      it will be either extremely easy or extremely difficult, but this is not
      always true. So it is important to approach each section with EQUAL vigor
      and attention. <p>A. Verbal</p><p> It is composed of following
      items </p><ul><li>i. Writing (AWA) Argument (30 minutes) Issue (30 minutes)</li><li> ii. Fill
