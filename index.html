    <p>Some of the students may have a clear goal set in front of them others might be at crossroads thinking about where to go next.
        There are ofcourse many options but here we discuss mainly one of the topics which is pursuining Higher Studies.<br>
        Even with pursuining Higher Education, everyone has a different motive, some of us just want to get a comprehensive 
        knowledge of the subject while others might just be looking for a qualification that would boost your salary a little.<br>
        I also have been in this situation and the analysis of the fields took a lot of time. I did find out a lot of things over 
        the course of my analysis and just to save others like me some time I'd like to share some of my opinions about the things I
        came across. Hopefully you'll find it helpful.<br>
        Cheers!

    <p>Well to obtain anything, you need to have some idea as to where to begin. The way I saw it, there were two paths:<br>

                Here the candidate is predisposed in learning their topic of interest at great depths. 
                This can be achieved by a variety of means. Online 6 to 12 months course from Udacity, Coursera, and 
                LinkedIn to name a few, or apply for master ’s degree either in India via GATE (M. Tech) or in a foreign 
                country like US, Germany, U.K, Netherlands etc (M.Sc). <br>
                <b>If your goal is “learning more”, then your profile shall also reflect the same.</b>
            </p>
            <h3>Here are a few ways to achive that:</h3>
            <span>Here are some tips for U.G students</span>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    The first step is to figure out your area of interest. It may be a topic within the department you belong or maybe 
                    even outside. For example, considering a student from Mechanical Engineering department, there are numerous subjects like 
                    thermodynamics, heat transfer, CFD, manufacturing, material science, automobile etc
    
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    You need to figure out which of these subjects interests you the most. Say, Automobile. Now even this topic has 
                    endless sub-sections like IC engine, powertrains, electric vehicles, material science, design of components, 
                    heat transfer, autonomous driving, battery etc
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    It is important to have an overall idea about each of these topics. After that, you have to choose what exactly 
                    you’d like to pursue in your master’s program. This decision can be made using a variety of parameters, each 
                    having individual priority level
                    <ol type="a"><br>
                        <li>Personal Interest:- This is generally governed by the people one is surrounded with during 12th and U.G. 
                            People are usually aware about topics, only upto the extent their friends and family are aware. At this 
                            stage you can figure out what exactly your AOI (area of interest) is through at least a month of 
                            self-introspection (minimum a month)
                        </li> <br>
                        <li>
                            Scope of development:- If you’re willing to spend 50 to 60 lakhs in US for M.Sc or 20-30 Lakhs in 
                            Germany/U.K, it is crucial that you land a high paying job at its end. This severely depends on the 
                            subjects you choose, which aim at the particular job market in that country. The companies need to 
                            sponsor your visa, and if you know stuff which is the same as their own citizens, it’s difficult to 
                            compete with them. So it’s very important you enter a field which is new, developing and have a great 
                            demand to land that mouth drooling high salaried job. For instance, people from Tech backgrounds land 
                            a job much easily due to high demand as compared to those from manufacturing backgrounds. 
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    After deciding your topic of interest, approach a professor in your institute who is active in this field. 
                    The early you approach, the better. Approach can be made as a group, however singular is preferable as it 
                    gives more freedom in pursuing different topics.
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    9 out of 10 times the professor won’t have much idea about the topic you chose but is only remotely related to 
                    the “subject”. That’s okay. You need not change your goals according to the availability of resources 
                    (that comes later XD). All you need to do is convince him to work under you and simply guide you in terms 
                    of set progress and connect you with appropriate people working on the same topic.
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    Begin your project. This means start talking to people. Call everyone and anyone you know or have contact with 
                    or work on the same topic as yours. This will give you an idea what you’ll be getting yourself into. This will 
                    also let you know the numerous resources you should access that shall help you in developing the skills 
                    necessary for your research project.
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    As you gain knowledge, usually by reading journals and books of your AOI, start making a report. List down 
                    names of important topics, made assumptions and derived conclusions. Now comes the best part. Knowing what 
                    exactly you’re “supposed” to do with this.
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    The aim, the ultimate aim, is to find a problem statement. Finding the PS is 60% of your job. Solving it is 
                    next 30% and publishing it is remaining 10%. How to find problem statement
                    <ol type="a"><br>
                        <li>
                            List down all the assumptions. Now alter one of them, and see how the results deflect. Now see how this 
                            assumption can be changed from ideal to real situation and in what way the model should be changed to 
                            give results for this real situation. This is one of the most difficult tasks to achieve, but can be 
                            done in steps and partial efficiency.
                        </li> <br>
                        <li>
                            List down all the conclusions. Many of them will be subjective to specific parameters, surrounding 
                            conditions and theorems. You can simply alter these parameters and derive results for your choice of 
                            control condition. This is one of the easiest ways of achieving results but also done by many. So the 
                            main thing is to dig into a topic where few people have reached so far. And dig in quickly.
                        </li> 
                    </ol>
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    After doing all this, you’ll have quite an idea of what is the current technological situation in this topic. 
                    How it is flawed, where it needs work and what can be done to improve it. Great! If your professor is 
                    experienced enough, he definitely receives an invitation for National and International Conferences. 
                    These are topic oriented and their purpose is only to gather scholars and researchers under one roof, 
                    and “discuss'' current technological status. That’s it. You need not achieve groundbreaking results or 
                    develop models or algorithms no one has even seen or some shit. Only addressing problem statements, 
                    their assumptions and conclusions, and what can be done to solve them is more than enough.

                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    Publish two to three reports in International conferences like this with DOI numbers where your academic 
                    profile is set for master’s application. Carry on with your research (if time permits), and one can also 
                    end up with a good research journal in their name, in U.G!

            <p>
                Here the candidate is solely interested in either diversifying their career profile or achieving a higher tier in their 
                current profile. Industrial oriented prerequisites should be thus kept in mind to achieve said target. Master programs 
                like M. Engg are opted by such individuals which are the same as M.Sc (theoretical and academic) but there are few 
                compulsory courses specific to management and industrial operation. <br>
                <b>One can opt in either M. Engg or M. Sc but it’s good to know the difference between the two and have some clarity. </b>
                <br> Here are some details regarding that:
            </p>
                    <span class="sub-head">Focus more on landing good internships.</span>
                    <p class ="add-detail">These are usually scored by personal favours from contacts in industry. 
                        People suggest using LinkedIn but rarely it helps and it also feels a huge waste of time when it doesn’t work.</p>
                <br>
                <span class="sub-head">Diversify your profile</span>
                   <p class="add-detail">When you’re industrial oriented, it is important to have skills in multiple fields. 
                    Opt for internships in companies who cater to different types of problems or clients. During the course of 
                    internship, try to get into a project. Even if it isn’t official, try to make some valuable contribution in 
                    the firm during your stay there.</p>
                <br>
                    <span class="sub-head">Contributions are important!</span>
                    <p class="add-detail">This is important because at interviews, the hiring side is greatly interested in what you have done with the 
                        skills you acquired in U.G and P.G as compared to what skills you acquired in U.G and P.G. It’s kind of obvious 
                        when you read it but not so much when you’re living through it.</p>
                    <span class="sub-head">The more applicative your resume lights, the more interviews you can crack</span> 
                    <p class="add-detail">Discuss with employees of companies. 
                        What did they do to get here? What do they do in their weekly working hours? What responsibilities they had in 
                        the beginning and what they have right now? You’ll figure out a pattern which will be subjective to certain types 
                        of companies and get an idea of what all you need to do in the coming time.</p>

                        Review 7 to 8 sample SOPs and decide a structure for yourself and make sure it fits in two pages at the most.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        First paragraph should provide a brief introduction about yourself and your history (in one line) and end by just 
                        giving a hint from where your motivation for the program emerged.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Expand this “motivation” in the second paragraph in 50 to 70 words.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Now dive into professional achievements, chronologically, mentioning “why” you did them and “what” results 
                        were obtained. The results might be technical or abstract (learning’s etc)
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Cover two to three paragraphs with this</li><br>
                    <li>The last paragraph is the most important. We need to end it on the high note. And this is going to take some efforts.</li>
                    <br><li>
                        GO to the university website and learn about the program you’re applying for. Figure out which professors are working in your interested areas, what labs does the program offer, what places you’d like to work in or with.  
                        Basically why you want to get into “this” particular university.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        It is quite hard to determine, why “this” university, when we are applying to five to 
                        six of them. But this is exactly why it is so very important.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Mention this in the last paragraph. Mention names of at least two professors you want to work with if selected, 
                        a lab you’d like to have a project in. Mention what plans you have after completion of your course. 
                        How this will help you in achieving it.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        You’re golden now.
